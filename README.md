# clave

WIST Protocol aggregator. Clave pulls signed deltas from publishers (via ping + the
publisher's `.well-known/wist` tree), verifies each one against its schema
and signature before admitting it, and seals them hourly into a public,
hash-chained, append-only log — the Certificate Transparency model applied
to a web index. It also serves the log, checkpoints, and periodic snapshots
over HTTP for consumers to sync against.

Subcommands: `init` (generate the log's genesis key and local store),
`serve` (HTTP ingest + read endpoints), `seal` (cut the next Block from
pending entries and chain it), `snapshot` (build a signed, verifiable
point-in-time index for cold-start sync), `param-change` (queue a signed
`parameter_change` Registry Update, WIST-4 §9: bounds and combination
rules checked, `effective_at` held past the grace period, applied to the
live parameter set once its Block seals and the effective instant passes;
a change whose grace window lapses while queued is dropped from the Block
and reported by `seal`), `sanction` / `rule` / `lift` (WIST-4 §7 ladder:
a level 3/4 sanction seals its notice first; rulings and lifts close or
clear the process; in-force state honors the lapsed-deadline void rules),
`withdraw` (payload withdrawal: deletes the Payload, drops the record,
stops serving snapshots that still contain it), `poll-appeals` (fetches
every sanction notice's appeal path despite the 403, seals served appeals
or an unappealed ruling once the window closes; also run by `serve`'s
baseline pass), `mirror` (maintain the signed `/log/mirrors.json`).

`serve` additionally enforces the reputation-derived ping quota (429 +
Retry-After; only WIST2-E02/E04 pings count as noise), rejects quarantined
and delisted domains with 403, and runs a baseline pass every minute that
re-pulls stale or budget-suspended publishers without a Ping. Ingest
follows feed pages (WIST-2 §3.2) under the per-domain daily byte budget,
suspending and resuming across days. Snapshots carry tier0 SQLite and
tier1 Parquet (extracts + link graph), optionally sharded
(`snapshot_shard_count` in the local params table).

## Build & test

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
```

Conformance tests read the spec repo's schemas/vectors from `../spec`
(sibling checkout) by default, or from `WIST_SPEC_DIR` if set. Building also
resolves `wist-core` from `../core` — both must be sibling checkouts.

## Verification

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test
cargo deny check
```

## Spec

Protocol definitions live in the sibling [spec repo](../spec) — WIST-3
(logbook & distribution: blocks, Merkle proofs, checkpoints, snapshots) is
what Clave implements, on top of the WIST-1 deltas it ingests.
